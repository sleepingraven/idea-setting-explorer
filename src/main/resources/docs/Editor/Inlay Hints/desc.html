<p><q>Inlay hints are special markers that appear in the editor and provide you with additional information about your
	code, like the names of the parameters that a called method expects. Other types of hints inform you about
	annotations, method parameters, usages, and so on (depending on the language).</q></p>
<p><q>In inlay hints settings you can configure which types of information you want to get in hints.</q></p>
