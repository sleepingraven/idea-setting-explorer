<p><q>Use this selector to choose how IntelliJ IDEA should create <a
		href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8'>UTF-8</a> files:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark'>byte order mark (BOM)</a>,</li>
	<li>without BOM,</li>
	<li>or BOM only for Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p><q>This option can be helpful if you work on an OS other than Windows and want more flexibility for the UTF-8 file
	encoding.</q></p>
<p><q>Keep in mind that the <span class='keyword'>UTF-8 with BOM</span> option may cause problems with software which is
	not compatible with BOM or with scripts that need to be run by an interpreter.</q></p>
