<p><q>This area displays the list of user-defined dictionary files, which can be any of the following:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The built-in <span class='emphasis'>project-level</span> and <span class='emphasis'>application-level</span>
		dictionaries, which you populate by manually saving words to them.
	</li>
	<li>
		Plain text files with the <span class='filepath'>DIC</span> extension, containing words separated with a new
		line.
	</li>
	<li>
		Hunspell dictionaries, comprise two plain text files commonly sharing the same name, for example, <span
			class='filepath'>en_GB.dic</span> and <span class='filepath'>en_GB.aff</span>. The <span class='filepath'>DIC</span>
		file contains a list of words together with the applicable modification rules. The <span
			class='filepath'>AFF</span> file lists prefixes and suffixes regulated by a specific modification rule.
		Hunspell dictionaries can be easily obtained online, for example, <a
			href='https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries'>here</a>.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><q>(Hunspell support is provided by the corresponding <span class='keyword'>Hunspell</span> plugin. The plugin is not
	bundled with IntelliJ IDEA, but it can be installed on the <span
			class='composite'>Settings/Preferences | Plugins</span> page as described in <a
			href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#install_plugin_from_repo'>Installing plugins
		from JetBrains repository</a>.)</q></p>
