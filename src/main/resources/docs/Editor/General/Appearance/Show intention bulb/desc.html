<p><q>Whenever IntelliJ IDEA detects that your code can be modified or improved, a light bulb icon appears on the
	current line in the editor: <span class='widget'>the Intention action icon</span> for intention actions and <span
			class='widget'>the Quick-fix icon</span> for quick-fixes. Clear this checkbox if you don't
	want to see these icons. You can still access the list of available actions and quick-fixes by pressing <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd>.</q>
