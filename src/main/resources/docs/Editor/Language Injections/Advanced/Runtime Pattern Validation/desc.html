<p><q>In this area, configure the runtime checks to be generated for the <code>@Pattern</code> validation. The available
	options are:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>No runtime instrumentation:
		if this option is selected, no checks will be inserted and any compiled class files will be affected.
	</li>
	<li>Instrument with assertions:if this option is selected, pattern-validation is controlled with the
		<code>-ea</code> JVM switch and throws <code>AssertionError</code>.
		<p><q>(Selecting this option is recommended due to the potentially negative impact on the performance for
			methods that are invoked very often.)</q></p>
	</li>
	<li>Instrument with IllegalArgumentException:
		select this option to have the same result as when the <code>@NotNull</code> instrumentation of IntelliJ IDEA is
		used.
	</li>
</ul>
