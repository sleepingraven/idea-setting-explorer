<p><q>This option specifies what kind of output the GUI Designer generates for the visual forms you create.</q></p>
<p><q>(If your build actions are <a
		href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-gradle-projects.html#delegate_build_actions'>delegated to
	Gradle</a>, GUI Designer will not generate Java source code.)</q></p>
<p><q>The available settings are:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Binary class files:
		This is the default option. When selected, no Java source code is generated for GUI forms and components. When
		the project compiles, IntelliJ IDEA creates the necessary compiled runtime classes.
	</li>
	<li>Java source files:
		If this option is selected, the GUI Designer writes Java source code for the form and its components to the
		source file of the class to which the form <a
				href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/binding-the-form-and-components-to-code.html'>is bound</a>, on
		compiling, running or debugging. During compilation, two blocks of code are added to the form's class:
		<ul>
			<li>A private method <code>$$$setupUI$$$()</code> that contains the GUI initializer code for the bound form
				and its components.
			</li>
			<li>A call to the <code>$$$setupUI$$$()</code> method.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><q>(Do not change the generated method, or call it from any other code. If you manually modify GUI
			initializer code, your UI will no longer be in sync with the <span class='filepath'>.form</span> file, and
			the next compilation will overwrite your changes.)</q></p>
	</li>
</ul>
