<p><q>On this page, create a list of run/debug configurations to be launched automatically on the project start. This
	may be helpful if you run some Grunt or Gulp.js tasks or npm scripts on a regular basis. All you need is just add
	the run/debug configurations that launch such tasks or scripts to the list of startup tasks.</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Run Configuration This read-only field shows the names of the run configurations to be launched on the project
		start.
	</li>
	<li>Shared:
		When this checkbox is selected, the corresponding task is available for other team members. Note that you can
		share only those run configurations that are already marked as shared in their definitions.
		<p>If the <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-managing-projects.html#project-formats'>directory-based
			project format</a> is used, the settings for a run/debug configuration are stored in a separate .xml file in
			the <span class='filepath'>.idea\runConfigurations</span> folder if the run/debug configuration is shared,
			or in the <span class='filepath'>.idea\workspace.xml</span> file otherwise.</p>
		<p>If the <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-managing-projects.html#project-formats'>file-based
			format</a> is used, the settings are stored in the <span class='filepath'>.ipr</span> file for shared
			configurations, or in the <span class='filepath'>.iws</span> file otherwise.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Add:
		Click this button to add one of the run/debug configurations that are currently defined in the project to the
		list of tasks to be executed on the project start. Choose the relevant configurations from the list or choose
		<span class='keyword'>Edit Configurations</span> to open the <a
				href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configurations-dialog.html'>Run/debug configurations
			dialog</a> dialog and define a required configuration in it.
	</li>
	<li>Remove:
		Click this button to delete the selected task from the list.
	</li>
	<li>Edit:
		Click this button to open the <a
				href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configurations-dialog.html'>Run/debug configurations
			dialog</a> dialog with the settings from the selected configuration and update them as required.
	</li>
