<p><q>Each line in the area under <span class='composite'>Quotation</span> is a quotation pattern (see <span
		class='composite'>Quote values</span>). A quotation pattern includes:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Left:
		a quotation character that is inserted before a value.
	</li>
	<li>Right:
		a quotation character that is inserted after a value.
	</li>
	<li>Escape:
		an escape method or character for the cases when the quotation character is part of a value. The <span
				class='keyword'>&lt;duplicate&gt;</span> value means that if a quotation character occurs within a
		value, it is doubled. You can specify your own escape character.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><q>If there is more than one pattern, the first pattern is used.</q></p>
