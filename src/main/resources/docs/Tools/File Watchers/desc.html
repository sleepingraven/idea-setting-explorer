<p><q>The page is available when the <span class='emphasis'>File Watchers</span> plugin is enabled. For more information
	about configuring File Watchers, see <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-file-watchers.html'>File
		watchers</a>. The <span class='emphasis'>File Watchers</span> plugin is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA, but it
	can be installed on the <span class='composite'>Settings/Preferences | Plugins</span> page as described in <a
			href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#install_plugin_from_repo'>Installing plugins
		from JetBrains repository</a>.</q></p>
<p><q>A <span class='emphasis'>File Watcher</span> is a IntelliJ IDEA system that tracks changes to your files and runs
	a third-party standalone application. IntelliJ IDEA provides predefined File Watcher templates for a number of such
	standard popular third-party tools (<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler'>compilers</a>,
	compressors, prettifiers, and others).</q></p>
<p><q>You can also configure a custom File Watcher to run any other third-party tool.</q></p>
<p><q>File watchers have two dedicated <span class='emphasis'>code inspections</span>:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>The <span class='emphasis'>File Watcher available</span> inspection is run in every file where a predefined File
		Watcher is applicable. If the project has no relevant File Watcher configured, IntelliJ IDEA suggests to add
		one.
	</li>
	<li>The <span class='emphasis'>File watcher problems</span> inspection is invoked by a running File Watcher and
		highlights errors specific to it.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><q>The page consists of a list of available File Watchers and a toolbar to manage this list.</q></p>
<p><q>For each File Watcher, you can decide if itâ€™s going to be available only in the current project (select <span
		class='keyword'>Project</span> from the <span class='keyword'>Level</span>list) or for all projects (select
	<span class='keyword'>Global</span>).</q></p>
<p><q>To activate a <span class='emphasis'>File Watcher</span>, select the checkbox next to it. When a File Watcher is
	enabled, it starts automatically as soon as a file of the selected type and in the selected scope is changed or
	saved, see <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-file-watchers.html#ws_filewatcher_advanced_options'>Configuring
		advanced options</a>. If an error occurs while a File Watcher is running, the File Watcher is automatically
	disabled. To restore the status, enable the File Watcher manually.</q></p>
<hr />

<p><q>Use the <span class='keyword'>New Watcher</span> dialog to create a project File Watcher based on a predefined
	IntelliJ IDEA File Watcher template or to edit an existing project File Watcher.</q></p>
<p><q>Each template contains the settings that are optimal for the selected tool. So in most cases, all you need is
	specify the path to the tool's executable.</q></p>

<ul>
	<li>Name:
		In the <span class='keyword'>Name</span> field, type the name of the File Watcher. By default, IntelliJ IDEA
		suggests the name of the selected predefined template.
	</li>
	<li>Files to Watch:
		<ul>
			<li>File type:
				Use this list to specify the expected type of input files. The File Watcher will consider only files of
				this type as subject for analyzing and processing. File types are recognised based on <a
						href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-registering-file-types.html#register-new-association'>associations
					between file types and file extensions</a>.
				<p>(By default, the field shows the file type in accordance with the chosen predefined template.)</p>
			</li>
			<li>Scope:
				Use this list to define the range of files the File Watcher can be applied to.
				<p>Changes in these files will invoke the File Watcher either immediately or upon save or frame
					deactivation, depending on the status of the <span class='composite'>Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher</span>
					checkbox.</p>
				<p>Select one of the predefined scopes from the list. For a project-level File Watcher, you can also
					click <span class='widget'>the Browse button</span> to configure a custom scope in the <span
							class='keyword'>Scopes</span> dialog that opens.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All Places:
						all the scopes listed below.
					</li>
					<li>Project Files:
						all the files within the project content roots (see <a
								href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/content-roots.html'>Content roots</a>).
					</li>
					<li>Project Production Files:
						all the files within the project content roots excluding test sources.
					</li>
					<li>Project Test Files:
						all the files within the project test source roots.
					</li>
					<li>Scratches and Consoles:
						all the files from the <span class='keyword'>Scratches and Consoles</span> directory located in
						the <span class='keyword'>Project</span> tool window.
					</li>
					<li>Open Files:
						all the files that are currently opened in the editor.
					</li>
					<li>Current File:
						the file opened in the active editor tab.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p><span class='keyword'>VCS Scopes</span>: these scopes are only available if your <a
						href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/enabling-version-control.html#associate_project_with_VCS'>project
					is under version control</a>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All Changed Files:
						all changed files, that is, all files associated with all existing changelists.
					</li>
					<li>Default Changelist:
						all the files associated with the changelist <code>Default</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Alternatively, click <span class='widget'>the Browse button</span> and configure a <span
						class='emphasis'>custom scope</span> in the <span class='emphasis'>Scopes</span> dialog that
					opens.</p>
				<p>(See <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-scopes-and-file-colors.html'>Scopes and
					file colors</a> for details.)</p>
			</li>
			<li>Track only root files:
				A <span class='emphasis'>root file</span> is a file that is not included (for example via
				<code>import</code>) in any other file <span class='emphasis'>within the specified scope</span>.
				<ul>
					<li>When this checkbox is selected, the File Watcher runs only against the <span class='emphasis'>root files</span>.
					</li>
					<li>When the checkbox is cleared, the File Watcher runs against the file from which it is invoked
						and against all the files in which this file is included recursively within the specified scope.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Note that the <span class='keyword'>Scope</span> setting overrides the <span class='composite'>Track only root files</span>
					checkbox setting: if a dependency is outside the specified scope, the File Watcher is not applied to
					it.</p>
				<p><span class='emphasis'>Example</span></p>
				<p>Suppose you have two files <span class='filepath'>root.scss</span> and <span class='filepath'>another.scss</span>
					where <span class='filepath'>root.scss</span> imports <span class='filepath'>another.scss</span>.
					With the <span class='composite'>Track only root files</span> checkbox selected, editing <span
							class='filepath'>another.scss</span> invokes the File Watcher only on <span
							class='filepath'>root.scss</span>. Otherwise, if the checkbox is cleared, the File Watcher
					processes both of these files.</p>
				<p>(This option is available only for <span class='emphasis'>Babel</span>, <span class='emphasis'>Closure Compiler</span>,
					<span class='emphasis'>Jade</span>, <span class='emphasis'>Less</span>, <span class='emphasis'>Sass/SCSS</span>,
					<span class='emphasis'>Stylus</span>, and <span class='emphasis'>UglifyJS</span>.)</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Tool to run on changes:
		In this area, configure interaction with the tool: specify the executable file to use, the arguments to pass to
		it, and where IntelliJ IDEA should look for the tool's output.
		<ul>
			<li>Program:
				<p>In this field, specify the path to the tool's executable file (<span class='filepath'>.com</span>,
					<span class='filepath'>.exe</span>, <span class='filepath'>.cmd</span>, <span
							class='filepath'>.bat</span>, or other depending on the specific tool.)</p>
				(
				<ul>
					<li>To use the program filename instead of filename path, add the path to its folder to the system
						environment variable PATH.
					</li>
					<li>On Windows, you can skip the <span class='filepath'>.com</span>, <span
							class='filepath'>.exe</span>, <span class='filepath'>.cmd</span> or <span class='filepath'>.bat</span>
						extension.
					</li>
					<li>To use a <span class='filepath'>jar</span> archive, specify the absolute path to it.
						Alternatively, to use a relative path, add its parent folder to the <a
								href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/absolute-path-variables.html'>IntelliJ IDEA
							path variables</a> on the <span
								class='keyword'>Appearance & Behavior | Path Variables</span> page of the <span
								class='keyword'>Settings/Preferences</span> <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+S</kbd>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				)
			</li>
			<li>Arguments:
				In this field, define the arguments to pass to the tool and thus influence its behaviour.
				<p>Arguments are usually specified using macros, for example, <code>$FileName$</code> or <code>$FileNameWithoutExtension$</code>,
					that will be replaced with actual file names.</p>
				<p>Type the macros manually or click <span class='widget'>the Insert Macros icon</span> and select the
					relevant pattern fom the list in the <span class='keyword'>Macros</span> dialog that opens.</p>
				(
				<p>When specifying the arguments, follow these rules:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use spaces as separators.</li>
					<li>If an argument contains spaces, enclose them or the entire argument in double quotes: <code>some"
						"arg</code> or <code>"some arg"</code>.
					</li>
					<li>If an argument contains double quotes, use backslashes to escape them: <code>-Dmy.prop=\"quoted_value"\</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				)
			</li>
			<li>Output paths to refresh:
				In this field, tell IntelliJ IDEA where it should search for the tool's output: the resulting source
				code, source maps, dependencies, or the file itself. The location of the output is tool-specific.
				<p>Output paths are usually specified using macros. You can type them manually or click <span
						class='widget'>the Insert Macros icon</span> and select the relevant one from the list in the
					dialog that opens.</p>
				<p>Note, that changing the value in the <span class='composite'>Output paths to refresh</span> field
					does not make the tool store its output in another place. If you still need to do that, specify the
					desired custom output location in the <span class='keyword'>Arguments</span> field: type the output
					paths with colons as separators and use macros.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Working Directory and Environment Variables:
		<ul>
			<li>Working directory:
				In this field, specify the directory to which the tool will be applied. Because the tool is always
				invoked in the context of a file, the default working directory is the directory of the current file.
				The default working directory is specified in all predefined templates through a <code>$FileDir$</code>
				macros. To specify a custom working directory, type the path to it in the field, or click <span
						class='widget'>the Browse icon</span> and select the directory in the <span class='keyword'>Select Path</span>
				dialog, or click <span class='widget'>the Insert Macros icon</span> and select the desired macro from
				the list in the <span class='keyword'>Macros</span> dialog.
				<p>(If you leave the <span class='composite'>Working Directory</span> field empty, IntelliJ IDEA uses
					the directory of the file where the File Watcher is invoked.)</p>
			</li>
			<li>Environment variables:
				In this field, specify the environment variables that the tool requires but that are not specified at
				the operating system level.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Advanced Options:
		<ul>
			<li>Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher:
				<ul>
					<li>When this checkbox is selected, IntelliJ IDEA immediately saves a file as soon as you edit it so
						the File Watcher wakes up immediately.
					</li>
					<li>When the checkbox is cleared, the File Watcher starts upon save (<span class='keyword'>File | Save All</span>)
						or when you move the focus from IntelliJ IDEA (on frame deactivation).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Trigger the watcher on external changes:
				<ul>
					<li>When this checkbox is selected, the File Watcher wakes up on any changes to a file from its
						scope, including changes made outside IntelliJ IDEA or the changes after you checkout a branch
						in you version control system.
					</li>
					<li>When the checkbox is cleared, the File Watcher starts only when a file from its scope is updated
						from IntelliJ IDEA and ignores other changes, for example, changes received from your version
						control system.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Trigger watcher regardless of syntax errors:
				<ul>
					<li>When the checkbox is selected, the File Watcher start regardless of the syntactical correctness
						of a file. The File Watcher will start upon update, save, or frame deactivation, depending on
						the status of the <span class='composite'>Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher</span>
						checkbox.
					</li>
					<li>When this checkbox is cleared, the File Watcher ignores all triggers in files that are
						syntactically invalid and starts only in error-free files.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Create output file from stdout:
				<ul>
					<li>In most cases, this checkbox should be cleared because most tools write their output to the
						relevant files directly.
					</li>
					<li>When this checkbox is selected, IntelliJ IDEA reads the native tool's output <code>standard
						output stream (stdout)</code> and generates the resulting file from it. The name of the
						generated file is taken from the <span class='composite'>Output paths to refresh</span> field.
						If the field contains several names, the first one in the list is used.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Show console:
				<p>From this list, select when you want the File Watcher to open the console.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Always:
						with this option, the console always opens after the tool execution is completed.
					</li>
					<li>On error:
						with this option, the console opens after the tool execution only when the <code>Exit
							code</code> is different from <code>0</code>.
					</li>
					<li>Never:
						choose this option to suppress opening the console at all.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Output Filters:
				<p>In this field, specify the output filters associated with the tool. Based on these filters, absolute
					file paths and line numbers in the tool's output are converted into hyperlinks. Clicking those links
					opens the corresponding files in the editor.</p>
				<p>For example, to get useful error messages displayed, type <code>$FILE_PATH$:$LINE$ $MESSAGE$</code>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
