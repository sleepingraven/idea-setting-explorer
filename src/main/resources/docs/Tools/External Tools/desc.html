<p><q>Definethird-party standalone applications (code generators and analyzers, pre- and post- processors, database
	utilities, etc.) as external tools to be able to run them from IntelliJ IDEA.</q></p>
<p><q>You can pass contextual information (like the currently selected file, or your project source path) to the
	external tools, view the tool output, and more.</q></p>
<p><q>The tools defined on this page appear as commands in the <span class='keyword'>Tools</span> menu and in various
	context menus. They can also be assigned keyboard shortcuts (see the <a
			href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html'>Configuring
		Keyboards and Mouse Shortcuts</a> section).</q></p>
<p><q>Use the checkboxes to enable or disable the tools and the tool groups. The items that are not currently selected
	are not available in the <span class='keyword'>Tools</span> and context menus.</q></p>
<hr />

<p>You can edit the settings for your external tool in the <span class='keyword'>Create/Edit/Copy Tool</span> dialog.
</p>
<p><q>(External tools provide the absolute path of the files, not project-directory-relative ones!)</q></p>

<ul>
	<li>Name:</li>
	The name of the tool that appears as a command name in the <span class='keyword'>Tools</span> menu and the context
	menus.
	<li>Group:
		The group the tool belongs to. The tool groups correspond to submenus in the <span class='keyword'>Tools</span>
		menu and the context menus.
		<p>Select an existing group from the list.</p>
		<p>To create a new group, type its name in the list.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Description:
		The tool description (optional).
	</li>
	<li>Tool Settings:
		<ul>
			<li>Program:
				The path to the executable file to be run.
				<p>(Macros are resolved at runtime and let you specify context information such as currently selected
					file, your project source paths, and so on)</p>
			</li>
			<li>Arguments:
				The arguments to be passed to the program the way you'd specify them on the command line.
				<p>When specifying the arguments, follow these rules:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class='keyword'>Note</span> that external tools provide the absolute path of the files,
						not project-directory-relative ones.
					</li>
					<li>Use spaces to separate individual arguments.</li>
					<li>If an argument includes spaces, enclose the spaces or the argument that contains the spaces in
						double quotes, for example, <code>some" "arg</code> or <code>"some arg"</code>.
					</li>
					<li>If an argument includes double quotes (for example as part of the argument), escape the double
						quotes by means of the backslashes, for example, <code>-Dmy.prop=\"quoted_value\"</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Working directory:
				The path to the current working directory for the program.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Advanced Options:
		<ul>
			<li>Synchronize files after execution:
				Make IntelliJ IDEA aware of changes in the file system when the tool completes its execution.
			</li>
			<li>Open console for tool output:
				Open the console for viewing the tool output such error messages, etc.
			</li>
			<li>Make console active on message in stdout:
				Make the output console active and bring it forward when the corresponding event occurs.
			</li>
			<li>Make console active on message in stderr:
				The same as the previous option but for stderr.
			</li>
			<li>Output Filters:
				The output filters are used to turn absolute file paths and line numbers in the tool output into
				hyperlinks. You'll be able to use those links to open the corresponding files in the editor. You can
				specify one or several filters. Each line is a regular expression. You can use the following macros:
				<code>$FILE_PATH$</code>, <code>$LINE$</code> and <code>$COLUMN$</code>, for example,
				<pre>$FILE_PATH$:$LINE$:$COLUMN$:.*</pre>
			</li>
		</ul>
