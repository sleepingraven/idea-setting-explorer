<p><q>Specify here the fully qualified path to the directory, where the task <code>vagrant init</code> has been
	executed, and the <span class='filepath'>Vagrantfile</span> is initialized and stored.</q></p>
<p><q>A <span class='filepath'>Vagrantfile</span> is a configuration file that defines the <span class='emphasis'>instance</span>
	(<span class='emphasis'>virtual machine</span>) you need. The file contains the virtual IP address, port mappings,
	and the memory size to assign. The file can specify which folders are shared and which third-party software should
	be installed. According to the <span class='filepath'>Vagrantfile</span> your <span class='emphasis'>instance</span>
	(<span class='emphasis'>virtual machine</span>) is configured, provisioned against the relevant <span
			class='emphasis'>Vagrant base box</span>, and deployed on your computer. A <span class='filepath'>Vagrantfile</span>
	is created through the <code>vagrant init</code> command.</q></p>
<p><q>When creation of an <span class='emphasis'>instance</span> (<span class='emphasis'>virtual machine</span>) is
	invoked either through the <code>vagrant up</code> command or through the <span
			class='keyword'>Tools | Vagrant | Up</span> menu option, IntelliJ IDEA looks for the <span class='filepath'>Vagrantfile</span>
	in the directory specified in the <span class='composite'>Instance folder</span> field. For more information, see <a
			href='http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/'>http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/</a>.</q></p>
<p><q>You can create a <span class='filepath'>Vagrantfile</span> in any directory and appoint it as <span
		class='emphasis'>instance folder</span>. If the field is empty, IntelliJ IDEA will treat the <span
		class='emphasis'>project root</span> as the <span class='emphasis'>instance folder</span> and look for a <span
		class='filepath'>Vagrantfile</span> in it.</q></p>
