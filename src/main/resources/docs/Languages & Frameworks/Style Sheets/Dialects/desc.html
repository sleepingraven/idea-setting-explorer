<p><q>This page lets you specify which dialects are used in your project.</q></p>
<p><q>A dialect may be set at the project level, and also at the level of a directory or a file.</q></p>
<p><q>If a dialect is not specified explicitly, it is inherited from a higher hierarchical level.</q></p>
<p><q>The dialects specified explicitly are shown in black. The inherited values are shown in gray italic.</q></p>

<ul>
	<li>File/Directory:
		This column shows the hierarchy of files and folders in the project. Each row corresponds to a directory or a
		file.
	</li>
	<li>CSS Dialect:
		Specify the dialect to be used.
		<p>Click the cell of interest and select the necessary option from the list.</p>
		<p>In addition to particular dialects, you can select:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class='keyword'>Clear</span>. This will clear the corresponding cell. As a result, an option from
				a higher hierarchical level will be inherited.
