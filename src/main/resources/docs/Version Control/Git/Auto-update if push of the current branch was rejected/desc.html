<p><q>Select this checkbox if you want the current branch to be updated automatically if the <code>push</code> operation
	from the current branch to its tracked branch is rejected.</q></p>
<p><q>If this option is deselected, IntelliJ IDEA will display the <span class='keyword'>Push Rejected</span> dialog
	when <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/commit-and-push-changes.html#update_when_push_rejected'>pushing a
		branch</a> is rejected because your local repository and the remote storage are not synchronized.</q></p>
<p><q>Note the following:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		If you have never seen the <span class='keyword'>Push Rejected</span> dialog before and you are enabling the
		checkbox initially, IntelliJ IDEA will update the conflicting local branch silently by means of the
		<code>merge</code> operation.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you have already encountered the <span class='keyword'>Push Rejected</span> dialog and selected the <span
			class='keyword'>Remember the update method choice...</span> option, IntelliJ IDEA saves your last choice
		<code>rebase</code> or <code>merge</code> and will apply it to update the conflicting local branch silently.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><q>Accordingly, to change the "remembered" setting, clear the checkbox, access the <span class='keyword'>Push Rejected</span>
	dialog, select the <span class='keyword'>Auto-update if push ... rejected</span> option, and invoke another update
	strategy.</q></p>
