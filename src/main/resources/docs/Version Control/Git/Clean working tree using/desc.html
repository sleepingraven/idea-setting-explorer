<p><q>Select how you want uncommitted changes to be treated when you perform a project update:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Stash:
		local changes will be saved to a <a
				href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-on-several-features-simultaneously.html#stash'>git
			stash</a>. This is useful if you need to apply patches with stashed changes outside IntelliJ IDEA, as they
		are generated by Git itself.
	</li>
	<li>Shelve:
		IntelliJ IDEA will put local changes to a <a
				href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-on-several-features-simultaneously.html#shelve'>shelf</a>.
		Shelving is done by IntelliJ IDEA, and patches generated from shelved changes are normally applied inside
		IntelliJ IDEA.

</ul>
