<p><q>In this section, specify whether and how to put a file created in IntelliJ IDEA under version control:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Show options before adding to version control:
		newly created files are put under version control after you specify the options in the dialog that opens.
	</li>
	<li>Add silently:
		newly created files are automatically added to version control without any notification.
	</li>
	<li>Do not add:
		newly created files remain unversioned and you can put them under version control later.
	</li>
</ul>
