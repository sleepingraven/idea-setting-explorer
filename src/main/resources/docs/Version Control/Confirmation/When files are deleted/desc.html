<p><q>In this section, specify whether and how to remove a file from version control when the file is deleted:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Show options before removing from version control:
		files removed locally are also removed from VCS after you have selected it in the dialog that opens.
	</li>
	<li>Remove silently:
		all files removed locally are removed from VCS without asking for confirmation.
	</li>
	<li>Do not remove:
		files removed locally remain under version control.
	</li>
</ul>
