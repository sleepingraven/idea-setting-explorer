<p><q>In this section, specify IntelliJ IDEA behavior on deleting an empty changelist.</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Show options before removing:
		IntelliJ IDEA asks for confirmation before removing an empty changelist that has lost its active status.
		<p>If you choose to delete such a changelist, IntelliJ IDEA suggests selecting another changelist to be marked
			as active.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Remove silently:IntelliJ IDEA automatically deletes empty changelists that become inactive, except for the <span
			class='keyword'>Default</span> changelist.
	</li>
	<li>Do not remove:empty changelists are not deleted on loosing their active status.</li>
</ul>
