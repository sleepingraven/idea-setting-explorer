<p><q>This field shows the path to project directories or the project root(s).</q></p>
<p><q>For projects with Git or Mercurial integration enabled, IntelliJ IDEA scans project directories to check if there
	are Git/Mercurial repositories that are not controlled by the IDE. If such repositories are found, they are listed
	here under <span class='keyword'>Unregistered roots</span> and are marked grey. To add an unregistered root, select
	it in the list and click the <span class='widget'>Add</span> button.</q></p>
<p><q>IntelliJ IDEA also checks if registered roots are valid, in other words, that a Git/Mercurial repository exists at
	the specified path. If invalid repositories are detected, they are marked with red.</q></p>
