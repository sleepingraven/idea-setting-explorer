<p><q>Select the <span class='composite'>Send usage statistics when using EAP versions</span> checkbox to allow
	JetBrains to collect statistics on the features and actions that you use most frequently when working with IntelliJ
	IDEA in early access. Specifically, we collect information on:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Used features</li>
	<li>Installed plugins</li>
	<li>Programming languages</li>
	<li>Frameworks</li>
	<li>Number of files per project</li>
</ul>
<p><q>Collecting and analysing feature usage statistics helps us greatly in IDE development. It gives us a picture of
	the most and least used actions so that we could focus on those aspects that you require most.</q></p>
<p><q>(We respect your privacy: all feature usage statistics that we receive from you is strictly anonymous.)</q></p>
