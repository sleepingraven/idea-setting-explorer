<p><q>Use this page to set different background colors for distinguishing between project files of specific scopes.</q>
</p>
<p><q>(For more information on how to work with the feature, refer to <a
		href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-scopes-and-file-colors.html'>Scopes and file colors</a>.)</q>
</p>
<hr />

<p><q>Similarly to scopes, color associations can be <span class='keyword'>local</span> and <span
		class='keyword'>shared</span>.</q></p>
<ul>
	<li><span class='keyword'>Local colors</span> are only visible to you and are not shared through VCS.</li>
	<lI><span class='keyword'>Shared colors</span> are placed under version control so that people who work on a project
		can use the same color associations. They are stored in the project folder under <span
				class='keyword'>.idea</span> in the <span class='keyword'>fileColors.xml</span> file (for example:
		<span class='keyword'>MyProject/.idea/fileColors.xml</span>).
	</lI>
</ul>
