<p>Set the antialiasing on IDE level or editor level.</p>
<p>There are three options to select:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Subpixel:
		this option is recommended for LCD displays and takes advantage of the fact that each pixel on a color LCD is
		composed of red, green and blue sub-pixels. This allows smoothing text and rendering it with greater detail.
	</li>
	<li>Greyscale:
		this option is recommended for non-LCD displays or displays positioned vertically. It deals with text at the
		pixel level.
	</li>
	<li>No antialiasing:
		this option can be used for displays with high resolution, where non-antialiased fonts are rendered faster and
		may look better.
	</li>
</ul>
