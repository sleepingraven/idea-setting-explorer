<p><q>For security reasons, any request to a page on the built-in server from outside IntelliJ IDEA is by default
	rejected and the authorization popup is displayed.</q></p>
<img src='./Allow%20unsigned%20requests.png' alt='' />
<p><q>To access the requested page, click <span class='keyword'>Copy authorization URL to clipboard</span> and paste the
	generated token in the address bar of the browser.</q></p>
<p><q>However this behavior may be annoying, for example, it may block your debugging session if manual intervention is
	impossible. To suppress displaying the authorization popup, select the <span class='composite'>Allow unsigned requests</span>
	checkbox.</q></p>
