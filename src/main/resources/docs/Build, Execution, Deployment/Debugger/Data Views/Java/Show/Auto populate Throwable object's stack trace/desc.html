<p><q>When the program is suspended after throwing an exception or error, its stack trace doesn't have any elements in
	it yet. For the stack trace to be populated, you have to call <code>getStackTrace()</code> on this
	<code>Throwable</code>. When <span class='composite'>Auto populate Throwable object's stack trace</span> is enabled,
	IntelliJ IDEA does this for you.</q></p>
