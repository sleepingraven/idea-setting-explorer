<p><q>In this editor area, type the script to be executed in the console after its start-up and initialization. Note
	that syntax highlighting, code completion, import assistance, documentation, inspections and quick fixes are
	available in this editor:</q></p>
<img src='./Starting%20script.png' alt='' />
<p><q>By default, this area contains the following script, which causes printing out a header information and extending
	the system paths:</q></p>
<pre>import sys; print('Python %s on %s' % (sys.version, sys.platform))
sys.path.extend([WORKING_DIR_AND_PYTHON_PATHS])</pre>
<p><q>The <code>WORKING_DIR_AND_PYTHON_PATHS</code> variable is hardcoded in IntelliJ IDEA. It displays two paths: the
	project root and the working directory. The project root is the top-level directory of your project. The working
	directory may coincidence with the project root if not explicitly defined in the <span class='composite'>Working directory</span>
	field.</q></p>
<p><q>If you want to omit such a printout, delete this script.</q></p>
