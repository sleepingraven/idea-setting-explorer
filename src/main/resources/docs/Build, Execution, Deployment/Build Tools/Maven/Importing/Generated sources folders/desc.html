<p><q>Specify the directory of your source root when you reimport a project.</q></p>
<p><q>You can select one of the following options:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Don't detect:
		This option lets you skip the detection process.
	</li>
	<li>Detect automatically:
		This is a default option. When you select this option, IntelliJ IDEA automatically detects the location of the
		generated sources. IntelliJ IDEA also detects which directory to mark as a source root. However, IntelliJ IDEA
		searches for the generated sources only in <span class='filepath'>target/generated-sources</span> and <span
				class='filepath'>target/generated-sources/*</span> directories.
	</li>
	<li>target/generated-sources:
		This option enables you to mark the directory as source root manually.
	</li>
	<li>subdirectories of "target/generated-sources":
		This option enables you to mark a subdirectory as a source root manually.
	</li>
</ul>
