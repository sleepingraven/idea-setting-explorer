<p><q>Use this list to select how you want to <a
		href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-gradle-projects.html#delegate_build_gradle'>build and run
	your project</a>. Use <span class='keyword'>Gradle</span> as a default option or select <span class='keyword'>IntelliJ IDEA</span>.</q>
</p>
<p><q>In this case when you select <span class='keyword'>Build | Build Project</span> from the main menu, IntelliJ IDEA
	goes through source sets in all modules executing the Gradle task <code>classes</code>.</q></p>

<p><q>If you have a pure Java or a Kotlin project, it is sometimes better to select IntelliJ IDEA for building a
	project. IntelliJ IDEA supports the <a
			href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/compiling-applications.html#compile_module'>incremental build</a>
	which significantly speeds up the building process. Yet, keep in mind that the IntelliJ IDEA compiler does not
	support some parts of the Gradle project build processing and might cause problems in building your project
	correctly.</q></p>
