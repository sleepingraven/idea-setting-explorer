<p><q>Use this field to specify the location of stored Gradle caches, downloaded files, and so on.</q></p>
<p><q>If Gradle location has been defined by the environment variables <code>GRADLE_HOME</code> or <code>PATH</code>,
	then IntelliJ IDEA deduces this location, and suggests this path as the default value.</q></p>
<p><q>If the Gradle location has not been deduced from the environment variables, specify it manually, or click <span
		class='widget'>the Browse button</span>, and select the desired directory in <a

	value entered in this field takes preference over the environment variables.</q></p>
<p><q>IntelliJ IDEA also supports the custom Gradle location installed from the homebrew package manager.</q></p>
