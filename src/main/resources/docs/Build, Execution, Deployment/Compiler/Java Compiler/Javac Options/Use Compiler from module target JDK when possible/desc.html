<p><q>When this option is on and the version of the JDK associated with a module is different from that of the <span
		class='keyword'>build process JDK</span>, the compiler from the module JDK is used. The exception is when the
	version of the module JDK is earlier than 1.6. In such cases, the compiler from the build process JDK is used in the
	<a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html#BHCIJIEG'>cross-compilation
		mode</a> against the classes of the module JDK.</q></p>
<p><q>When the option is off, all the modules are compiled with the same compiler, the one from the build process JDK.
	When necessary, the cross-compilation mode is used.</q></p>
<p><q>To start the build process, the latest of the available JDKs is used. This JDK is chosen from all the JDKs used in
	your modules, the default project JDK, and also the JDK bundled with IntelliJ IDEA.</q></p>
<p><q><span class='keyword'>IMPORTANT!</span> The choice of the compiler does not affect the source code language level,
	and also the bytecode target level and linking. That is, irrespective of which compiler is used, the bytecode is
	linked against the JDK associated with the module, and the resulting code levels are exactly the ones that are
	specified in your project settings.</q></p>
<p><q>(For Java 9, the <code>--release</code> compiler option is set in <span class='composite'>Settings/Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler | Java Compiler</span>.
	It automatically configures the Java compiler to produce class files that will link against an implementation of the
	given platform version. If you need to switch this option off, clear the checkbox in the settings.)</q></p>
