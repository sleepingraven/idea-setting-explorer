<p><q>Select this checkbox to have the <span class='filepath'>.dex</span> file converted into a <span class='filepath'>.odex</span>
	file (optimized). The optimized <span class='filepath'>.odex</span> version of a <span class='filepath'>.dex</span>
	file is stored <span class='emphasis'>outside</span> the application package <span class='filepath'>.apk</span>.
	During the booting of the Android operating system, <span class='filepath'>.odexa</span> files make the basis for
	building a cache for the <span class='emphasis'>Dalvik</span> virtual machine. As a result, the operating system in
	advance knows what applications will be loaded.</q></p>
<p><q>When this checkbox is cleared, the generated <span class='filepath'>.dex</span> file is not optimized.</q></p>
<p><q>By default, the checkbox is selected.</q></p>
