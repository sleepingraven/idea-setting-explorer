<p><q>In this area, specify the basis for coding assistance by selecting or clearing the following checkboxes:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Type checking:
		When this checkbox is selected, syntax and error highlighting is provided based on the data received from the
		Flow server. When the checkbox is cleared, only the basic internal IntelliJ IDEA highlighting is available.
	</li>
	<li>Navigation, code completion, and type hinting:
		When this checkbox is selected, suggestion lists for reference resolution and code completion contain both
		suggestions retrieved from integration with Flow and suggestions calculated by IntelliJ IDEA. When the checkbox
		is cleared, references are resolved through IntelliJ IDEA calculation only.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><q>The checkboxes are available only when the path to the <span class='emphasis'>Flow executable</span> file is
