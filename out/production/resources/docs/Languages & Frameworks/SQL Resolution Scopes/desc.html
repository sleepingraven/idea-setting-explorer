<p><q>This page lets you specify the data sources, databases and schemas that should be used to resolve unqualified
	(short) names of database object in your SQL files.</q></p>
<p><q>(For this page to be available, the Database Tools and SQL plugin must be enabled. See <a
		href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html'>Manage plugins</a>.)</q></p>
<hr />

<p><q>The <span class='keyword'>Path / Resolution Scope</span> section describes mappings for individual files and
	directories.</q></p>
<p><q>If nothing is specified in this section, all the SQL files in your project use the project mapping.</q></p>
<p><q>The mappings specified explicitly are shown in black. The mappings inherited from a higher level (unless you close
	the dialog) are shown in gray italic.</q></p>
<hr />

<p><q>For Example, you have two data sources, one for your production database and the other one - for your test
	database. The tables in both databases have the same names but slightly different structures. And you keep the SQL
	scripts for your production and test databases separately, in two different folders.</q></p>
<p><q>In such a situation, you'd map the folder with the production scripts onto the production data source, and the
	folder with the test scripts onto the test data source.</q></p>
<p><q>The other possibility would be to use the project mapping for your production data source and specify the mapping
	for the test scripts folder separately, or vice versa.</q></p>
