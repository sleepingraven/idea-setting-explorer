<p><q>Normally, an HTML or an XHTML file has the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declaration which states the <span
		class='emphasis'>language level</span> of the used in the source code from the file. This language level is used
	as a standard against which the contents of the file are validated. If an HTML or an XHTML file does not have a
	<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declaration, the contents of the file will be validated against the default standard
	(schema). In the <span class='composite'>Default HTML language level</span> area, choose the default schema to
	validate HTML and XHTML files without a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declaration. The available options are:</q>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class='keyword'>HTML 4</span> or <span class='keyword'>HTML 5</span>:
		select one of these options to have files treated as HTML 4 or HTML 5 and validated against one of these
		standards.
	</li>
	<li><span class='keyword'>Other doctype</span>:
		select this option to have HTML files by default validated against a custom DTD or schema and specify the URL of
		the DTD or schema to be used.
		<p>Note that code completion is available in this field: press <kbd>Ctrl+Space</kbd> to see the list of
			suggested URLs.</p>
