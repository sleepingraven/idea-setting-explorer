<p><q>Click one of the radio buttons in this area to select the level of analysis and performance of the language
	injections resolution procedure.</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Do not analyze (fast):
		if this option is selected, IntelliJ IDEA does not analyze injections.
		<p><q>(Selecting the <span class='composite'>Do not analyze</span> option significantly improves
			performance.)</q></p>
	</li>
	<li>Analyze references:
		if this option is selected, IntelliJ IDEA attempts to recognize injections introduced through variables.
	</li>
	<li>Look for variable assignments:
		if this option is selected, IntelliJ IDEA does not perform the dataflow analysis to detect the substitution
		strings, but looks for variable assignments only.
	</li>
	<li>Use dataflow analysis (slow):
		if this option box is selected, IntelliJ IDEA applies <a
				href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/analyzing-data-flow.html'>dataflow analysis</a> to language
		injections.
	</li>
