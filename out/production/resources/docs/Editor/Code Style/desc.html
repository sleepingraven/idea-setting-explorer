<p><q>In this area, choose the code style scheme and change it as required. Code style scheme settings are automatically
	applied every time IntelliJ IDEA generates, refactors, or reformats your code.</q></p>
<p><q>Code styles are defined at the <span class='emphasis'>project level</span> and at the <span class='emphasis'>IDE level</span>
	(global).</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><q>At the project level, settings are grouped under the <span class='keyword'>Project</span> scheme, which is
			predefined and is marked in bold. The <span class='keyword'>Project</span> style scheme is applied to the
			current project only.</q></p>
		<p><q>You can copy the <span class='keyword'>Project</span> scheme to the IDE level, using the <span
				class='keyword'>Copy to IDE</span> command.</q></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><q>At the IDE level, settings are grouped under the predefined <span class='keyword'>Default</span> scheme
			(marked in bold), and any other scheme created by the user by the <span class='keyword'>Duplicate</span>
			command (marked as plain text). Global settings are used when the user doesn't want to keep code style
			settings with the project and share them.</q></p>
