<p><q>Use this list to configure where the caret should stop on line breaks. You can select from the following
	options:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Jump to next/previous line boundaries (IDE default):
		when you select this option, the caret moves forward to the beginning of the next line, and when moved
		backwards, the caret jumps to the end of the previous line.
	</li>
	<li>Ignore line breaks (Unix default):
		when you select this option, IntelliJ IDEA ignores the line breaks, and the caret moves according to the
		configuration specified in the <span class='composite'>When moving by words</span> list.
	</li>
	<li>Stop at both line boundaries (Windows default):
		when you select this option, the caret stops at both the start and the end of each line.
	</li>
	<li>Jump to current line boundaries:
		when you select this option, the caret always jumps to the end of the current line (when moved forward) or to
		the beginning of the current line (when moved backwards).
		<p>Check the following example when you have <span class='keyword'>Always jump to word start</span> specified in
			the <span class='composite'>When moving by words</span> list and <span class='keyword'>Jump to current line boundaries</span>
			specified in the <span class='composite'>Upon line break</span> list:</p>

	<li>Always jump to line start:
		when you select this option, the caret always moves to the start of a line.
	</li>
	<li>Always jump to line end:
		when you select this option, the caret always moves to the end of a line.
	</li>
</ul>
