<p><q>Use this list to configure where the caret should stop when moved by words. You can select from the following
	options:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Jump to current word boundaries (IDE default):
		<p>when you move the caret forward (<kbd>Ctrl+Right</kbd>), IntelliJ IDEA places it to the end of the current
			word.</p>
		<p>When you move the caret to the previous word (<kbd>Ctrl+Left</kbd>), IntelliJ IDEA places the caret in the
			beginning of the current word.</p>

	</li>
	<li>Always jump to word start (Windows default):
		when you select this option, the caret always moves to the beginning of the word.
	</li>
	<li>Always jump to word end:
		when you select this option, the caret always moves to the end of the word.
		<img src='./Always jump to word end.gif' alt='' />
	</li>
	<li>Jump to next/previous word boundaries:
		when you select this option, the caret moves forward to the start of the next word, and when moved backwards,
		the caret jumps to the end of the previous word.
	</li>
	<li>Stop at both word boundaries:
		when you select this option, the caret stops at both the start and the end of each word.
	</li>
</ul>
