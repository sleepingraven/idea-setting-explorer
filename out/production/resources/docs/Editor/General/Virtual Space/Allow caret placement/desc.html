<p>Virtual spaces is allowed for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>After the end of line:
		if this checkbox is selected, you will be able to set your caret anywhere after the last character in any line.
		As soon as you start typing at a position beyond the end of the line, the necessary number of spaces will be
		added between the end of the line and the beginning of your input.
	</li>
	<li>Inside tabs:
		select this checkbox to allow placing the caret inside tab characters. The reason is that each tab character
		shows in the editor as a set of 'virtual' space characters.
	</li>
</ul>
