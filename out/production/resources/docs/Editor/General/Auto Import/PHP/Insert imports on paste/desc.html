<p><q>Select how IntelliJ IDEA should process references to missing classes and methods in pasted blocks of code:</q>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>All:
		import statements will be added automatically for all missing classes and methods found in pasted blocks of
		code.
	</li>
	<li>Ask:
		IntelliJ IDEA will prompt you to select which classes and methods you want to import.
		<p>If the pasted class is already referenced in the target code <a
				href='http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.importing.php'>via an alias</a>, IntelliJ IDEA will
			prompt you to reuse this alias instead of creating a new import statement.</p>
		<img src='Insert imports on paste.png' alt='' />
	</li>
	<li>None:
		no import statements will be added, you won't be asked about unresolved references.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that adding imports on paste is only possible if the copied element is properly resolved in code (that is, not
	highlighted by the <span class='feature'>Undefined class</span> or <span class='feature'>Undefined method</span>
	inspections), and project indexing is finished.</p>
