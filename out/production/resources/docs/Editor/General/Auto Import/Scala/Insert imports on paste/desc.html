<ul>
	<li>Always:
		import statements will be added automatically for all missing classes, methods and fields found in pasted blocks
		of code.
	</li>
	<li>Ask:
		you will be prompted to select which classes, methods and fields you want to import.
	</li>
	<li>Never:
		no import statements will be added, you won't be asked about unresolved references.
