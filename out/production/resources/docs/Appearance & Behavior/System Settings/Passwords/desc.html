<p><q>By default, IntelliJ IDEA saves your passwords for version control repositories, databases, and other protected
	resources. Configure the way the passwords are saved:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>In native Keychain:
		<p>Use the native keychain app.</p>
		<p>This option is not available for Windows. macOS uses Keychain Access. For Linux, it depends on the desktop
			environment and available apps: if you have both GNOME Keyring and KWallet, IntelliJ IDEA will use GNOME
			Keyring
			for compatibility reasons because KWallet was not supported in previous versions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>In KeePass:
		Use the <a href='http://keepass.info/'>KeePass</a> password manager.
		<ul>
			<li>Database:
				<p>Specifies the location of the password database file <span class='keyword'>c.kdbx</span>.</p>
				<p>To change the location, click <span class='widget'>the Browse button</span> and select the new
					directory. To import another <span class='keyword'>c.kdbx</span> file, click <span class='widget'>the Settings menu</span>
					and select <span class='keyword'>Import</span>. To remove the existing passwords in the <span
							class='keyword'>c.kdbx</span>
					file, select <span class='keyword'>Clear</span> .</p>
				<p>Use the master password to access the password database <span class='keyword'>c.kdbx</span>. To set
					the master password for the database, click <span class='widget'>the Settings menu</span> and select
					<span class='keyword'>Set Master Password</span> . When IntelliJ IDEA remembers your passwords, it
					will not ask for the passwords again including the master password unless you need to access the
					password database.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Protect master password using PGP key:
				Encrypt the master password for the password database using PGP.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Do not save, forget passwords after restart:
		Do not remember any passwords and always prompt for credentials to protected resources.
	</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<p><q>The <span class='keyword'>Password Manager Database Updated</span> dialog opens only once when you launch a new
	IntelliJ IDEA version with configurations from the previous IntelliJ IDEA version.</q></p>
<p><q>IntelliJ IDEA lets you convert the current saved password database into a new one.</q></p>
<hr />

<p><q>If your master password is not set yet, you can open the <span class='keyword'>Setup Master Password</span> dialog
	by clicking <span class='keyword'>Master Password</span> on the <span class='composite'>Passwords</span> page. In
	certain circumstances, this dialog may also open automatically.</q></p>
<p><q>Specify the password that you want to be set as your master password. ( The master password is used to access the
	IntelliJ IDEA password database where - if so specified - your passwords are stored. Instead of the individual
	passwords, you'll be able to use your master password.)</q></p>
<p><q>You can set the password empty. As a result, IntelliJ IDEA won't ask you for the password when accessing the
	password database. However, the security of your passwords in that case will be lower.</q></p>
<hr />

<p><q>If your master password is already set, you can open the <span class='keyword'>Change Master Password</span>
	dialog by clicking <span class='keyword'>Master Password</span> on the <span class='composite'>Passwords</span>
	page.</q></p>
<p><q>Specify your current master password, and then a new master password. (The master password is used to access the
	IntelliJ IDEA password database where - if so specified - your passwords are stored.)</q></p>
<p><q>You can set the new password empty. As a result, IntelliJ IDEA won't ask you for the password when accessing the
	password database. However, the security of your passwords in that case will be lower.</q></p>
<p><q>If you don't remember the current password, you can reset the master password (click <span
		class='keyword'>Reset</span>).</q></p>
<hr />

<p><q>The <span class='keyword'>Enter Master Password</span> dialog opens automatically when IntelliJ IDEA needs to
	access its password database to retrieve the necessary password.</q></p>
<p><q>Specify your master password.</q></p>
<p><q>If you don't remember the password, you can reset it (click <span class='keyword'>Reset</span>).</q></p>
<hr />

<p><q>The <span class='keyword'>Master Password / Reset Master Password</span> dialog opens when you click <span
		class='keyword'>Reset</span> in the <span class='keyword'>Enter Master Password</span> or the <span
		class='keyword'>Change Master Password</span> dialog.</q></p>
<p><q>(If you reset the master password, all your passwords currently stored in the password database will be lost.)</q>
</p>
<p><q>Specify your new master password.</q></p>
<p><q>You can set the password empty. As a result, IntelliJ IDEA won't ask you for the password when accessing the
	password database. However, the security of your passwords in that case will be lower.</q></p>
<p><q>To come back to the previous dialog, click <span class='keyword'>Enter or Change</span>.</q></p>
