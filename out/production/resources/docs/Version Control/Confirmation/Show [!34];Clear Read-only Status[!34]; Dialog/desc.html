<p><q>Select this checkbox to have IntelliJ IDEA explicitly require cancellation of the read-only status when you open a
	file in the editor and try to modify it.</q></p>
<p><q>The read-only status can be cleared in two ways:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Using the current VCS:
		the file is added to a changelist
	</li>
	<li>Using a file system:
		the file is not added to the changelist.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><q>This option is relevant for the version control systems that separate check-out from opening for editing.</q></p>
