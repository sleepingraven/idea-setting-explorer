<p><q>If this option is enabled, IntelliJ IDEA will check if there are pending incoming commits that have not been
	fetched to your local repository, and will mark such branches in the <span class='keyword'>Branches</span>
	popup.</q></p>
<p><q>Select how you want to IntelliJ IDEA to query the remote to check for incoming commits:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Auto:
		IntelliJ IDEA will check for updates in the background if HTTP or Git protocol is used to access the remote. If
		SSH is used, this check will not be performed so that external authentication applications don't popup
		unexpectedly.
	</li>
	<li>Always:
		IntelliJ IDEA will check for updates in the background even if SSH is used to access the remote.
	</li>
	<li>Never:
		IntelliJ IDEA will not query the remote for incoming commits, and a warning will be displayed in the <span
				class='keyword'>Branches</span> popup, allowing you to run the check manually.
	</li>
</ul>
