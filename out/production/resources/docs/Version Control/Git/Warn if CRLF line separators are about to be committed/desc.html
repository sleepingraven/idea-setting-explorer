<p><q>Select this option to enable smart handling of <code>LF</code> and <code>CRLF</code> line separators. IntelliJ
	IDEA will analyze your configuration, warn you if you are about to commit CRLF into the repository, and suggest
	changing the <code>core.autocrlf</code> setting to <code>true</code> or <code>input</code> depending on your
	operating system.</q></p>
<p><q>(This setting is not applied to files where you have set any related Git attributes. In this case, IntelliJ IDEA
	assumes that you clearly understand what you are doing and excludes such files from analysis.)</q></p>
<p><q>If this option is deselected, you will have to fix issues with line endings manually using the <a
		href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/differences-viewer.html'>Difference Viewer dialog</a>.</q></p>
