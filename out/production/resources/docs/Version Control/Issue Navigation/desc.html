<p><q>Use this dialog to create a list of the so-called <span class='emphasis'>issue navigation patterns</span>. <span
		class='emphasis'>An issue navigation pattern</span> maps an <span class='emphasis'>issue ID pattern</span> in
	commit messages with the URL addresses of the referenced issues. This enables you to navigate from committed changes
	to issues related to these changes. As soon as IntelliJ IDEA encounters a match to the issue ID pattern in a commit
	message, the match is displayed as a link in the <span class='keyword'>Version Control</span> tool window
	<kbd>Alt+9</kbd>. If you mention several issues, all of them will be displayed as links. Clicking such link opens
	the matching issue in the default browser.</q></p>

<p><q>The example below shows how IntelliJ IDEA applies the abovementioned rules to detect a reference to an issue in a
	commit message and compose a link to it in the issue tracking system.</q></p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Issue ID pattern</td>
		<td>
			<p>The regular expression that defines the format in which issues are referenced in commit messages.</p>
			<pre>[A-Z]+\-\d+</pre>
			<p>This regular expressions matches all character strings that consist of two substrings separated by an
				n-dash character:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Substring 1: An unlimited number of upper case alphabetic characters.</li>
				<li>Substring 2: An unlimited number of digital characters.</li>
			</ol>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Issue link pattern</td>
		<td>
			<p>A combination of the URL address of your issue tracking system and a regular expression that identifies
				issues in it.</p>
			<pre>http://mytracker/issue/$0</pre>
			<p>Here <code>$0</code> indicates a back reference to the entire match. This means that as soon as IntelliJ
				IDEA detects a match in a commit message, it is added to the URL address of the tracker as is.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Matching issue ID</td>
		<td>
			<p>IntelliJ IDEA detects the following reference to an issue in the commit message of interest:</p>
			<pre>MYPROJECT-110</pre>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Composed issue link</td>
		<td>
			<p>In accordance with the above issue navigation pattern, the detected matching reference is added to the
				URL of the tracker as is, so the link to the referenced issue is composed as follows:</p>
			<pre>http://mytracker/issue/MYPROJECT-110</pre>
