<p><q>These VM options will be added to the command line on launching the build process. The user-local VM options are
	stored in <span class='filepath'>workspace.xml</span> file and as such are visible to the author of these changes
	only. The user-local VM options has the priority over the shared VM options. It means that if anything is written in
	the field <span class='composite'>User-local build process VM options</span>, then the field <span
			class='composite'>Shared build process VM options</span> is ignored, and the values in the <span
			class='composite'>User-local build process VM options</span> field are used instead.</q></p>
