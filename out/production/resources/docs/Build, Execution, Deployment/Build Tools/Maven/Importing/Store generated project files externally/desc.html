<p><q>By default, this option is not selected and the generated <span class='filepath'>.iml</span> and library files are
	stored inside the <span class='filepath'>.idea</span> directory.</q></p>
<p><q>It is helpful in the following cases:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		sharing the IDE-specific module settings via VCS since the <span class='filepath'>.idea</span> directory stores
		<a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configure-project-settings.html'>project-level settings</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		correctly opening a project that contains both regular IntelliJ IDEA modules and Maven modules.
	</li>
	<li>
		accessing a project faster when you open it since IntelliJ IDEA reads the <span class='filepath'>.iml</span>
		files first and then starts the importing process.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><q>(When you make changes in your Maven project, the <span class='filepath'>.iml</span> files get changed as well so
	don't forget to push them along with the other project's changes under VCS.)</q></p>
<p><q>If you want to store the generated <span class='filepath'>iml</span> and library files externally in <span
		class='filepath'>idea.system.path</span> , select this option.</q></p>
