<p><q>If this checkbox is not selected, the build will be created in the regular IntelliJ IDEA's output directory <span

	and the results of IntelliJ IDEA's compilation are reused. However, IntelliJ IDEA itself does not reuse Maven build
	results, and performs compilation <span class='emphasis'>from scratch</span>.</q></p>
