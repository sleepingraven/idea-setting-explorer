<p><q>IntelliJ IDEA allows you to specify how different objects are displayed in the debugger on a class-by-class basis.
	You can assign the expressions to be displayed rather than rely on the object's String representation.</q></p>
<p><q>For example, if an object represents a user, you may want it to be represented by login names; or, for a cache
	entry object, its content may be appropriate. IntelliJ IDEA refers to these as <span
			class='emphasis'>type renderers</span>.</q></p>
<p><q>All object types are supported (including primitive types and arrays).</q></p>
