<p><q>This option determines how the contents of an object are displayed when it is expanded.</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>Use default renderer:
		displays the node children as they would be displayed without this renderer. This is useful if you want to only
		customize the way the object itself is displayed.
	</li>
	<li>Use following expression:
		lets you use the return value of some expression for displaying the contents of a node, for example, <code>this.toArray()</code>.
		The expression has to return an array of primitive or reference types. The elements of the returned array are
		used to represent the node children.
		<p>Test if a node can be expanded (optional):
			adds an automatic check whether the node representing the object can be expanded. The check uses the
			specified boolean expression, for example <code>!this.isEmpty()</code>. The expression is called on the
			instance, and if it evaluates to <code>true</code>, the debugger makes the node expandable.</p></li>
	<li>Use list of expressions: allows you to specify multiple expressions each providing its own representation of the
		object's children. The <span class='composite'>On-demand</span> option disables their automatic evaluation and
		only calculates the result when you select a specific expression.
	</li>
</ul>
