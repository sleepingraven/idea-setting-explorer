<p><q>Select this option if you want the IntelliJ IDEA debugger to automatically evaluate expressions and show the
	corresponding values in the Variables pane of the <a
			href='https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debug-tool-window.html'>Debug tool window</a>.</q></p>
<p><q>The debugger analyzes the context near the breakpoint (the current statement, one statement before, and one
	after). It does so to find various expressions in the source code (if available) such as, for example, <code>myvar.myfield</code>.</q>
</p>
<p><q>If such expressions don't contain explicit method invocations, the debugger evaluates them and shows the
	corresponding values in the Variables view.</q></p>
<p><q>(In the languages such as Groovy, it is impossible to tell whether any methods are invoked when evaluating an
	expression, and such method invocations often cause unwanted side effects, so it is recommended to disable this
	option when debugging Groovy code.)</q></p>
